        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A lovely stew made with free-range chicke- wait no, a fine seared steak salted to- uh wait it's warm milk I guess? Maybe an elixer?</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tabantha Wheat (1 bundle)</li>
            <li>Fresh Milk (2 cups)</li>
            <li>Goat butter (4 tbsp)</li>
            <li>Full Chicken Wing (2 wings)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Simmer milk in the wok that you're making this in for some reason for 8 minutes or until thickened</li>
            <li>Incorportate butter half a table spoon at a time</li>
            <li>Cut wings into small pieces to add while cooking</li>
            <li>Begin incorporating chicken until stew gets a slight brown tint -- wait crap no, those are Keese wings oh god</li>
            <li>That's okay, I can work with this, I can fix this. Keese are very approximately chicken anyway</li>
            <li>Okay, grind the wheat using a mortar and pestle (or Drillshaft if you have one around) and begin integr- that made it so much worse why is it that color oh jeez</li>
            <li>Okay okay okay, I can save this</li>
            <li>We're doing an elixer now! So lets put in some Fireproof Lizards and...</li>
            <li>I forgot about the butter, this can't be an elixer now. Oh god mom is gonna be so mad</li>
            <li>... Actually, it doesn't smell too bad. I guess this is edible? Whatever, I'll just make Baked Apples again, can't screw that one up</li>
        </ol>
